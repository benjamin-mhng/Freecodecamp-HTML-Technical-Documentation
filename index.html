                <p>This specification defines a big part of the web platform, in lots of detail. Its place in the web
                    platform specification stack relative to other specifications can be best summed up as follows:</p>

                <p>This section is non-normative.
                <p>In short: Yes.</p>
                <p>In more length: the term "HTML5" is widely used as a buzzword to refer to modern web technologies,
                    many of which (though by no means all) are developed at the WHATWG. This document is one such;
                    others are available from the WHATWG Standards overview.</p>

                <p>This section is non-normative.</p>
                <p>HTML is the World Wide Web's core markup language. Originally, HTML was primarily designed as a
                    language for semantically describing scientific documents. Its general design, however, has enabled
                    it to be adapted, over the subsequent years, to describe a number of other types of documents and
                    even applications.</p>

            <article>
                <p>This section is non-normative.</p>
                <p>This specification is intended for authors of documents and scripts that use the features defined in
                    this specification, implementers of tools that operate on pages that use the features defined in
                    this specification, and individuals wishing to establish the correctness of documents or
                    implementations with respect to the requirements of this specification.</p>

                <p>This document is probably not suited to readers who do not already have at least a passing
                    familiarity with web technologies, as in places it sacrifices clarity for precision, and brevity for
                    completeness. More approachable tutorials and authoring guides can provide a gentler introduction to
                    the topic.</p>

                <p>In particular, familiarity with the basics of DOM is necessary for a complete understanding of some
                    of the more technical parts of this specification. An understanding of Web IDL, HTTP, XML, Unicode,
                    character encodings, JavaScript, and CSS will also be helpful in places but is not essential.</p>

            <h1 id="1.5">1.5 Scope</h1>
            <article>
                <p>This section is non-normative.</p>

                <p>This specification is limited to providing a semantic-level markup language and associated
                    semantic-level scripting APIs for authoring accessible pages on the web ranging from static
                    documents to dynamic applications.</p>

                <p>The scope of this specification does not include providing mechanisms for media-specific
                    customization of presentation (although default rendering rules for web browsers are included at the
                    end of this specification, and several mechanisms for hooking into CSS are provided as part of the
                    language).</p>

                <p>The scope of this specification is not to describe an entire operating system. In particular,
                    hardware configuration software, image manipulation tools, and applications that users would be
                    expected to use with high-end workstations on a daily basis are out of scope. In terms of
                    applications, this specification is targeted specifically at applications that would be expected to
                    be used by users on an occasional basis, or regularly but from disparate locations, with low CPU
                    requirements. Examples of such applications include online purchasing systems, searching systems,
                    games (especially multiplayer online games), public telephone books or address books, communications
                    software (e-mail clients, instant messaging clients, discussion software), document editing
                    software, etc.</p>

            <h1 id="1.6">1.6 History</h1>
            <article>
                <p>This section is non-normative.</p>

                <p>For its first five years (1990-1995), HTML went through a number of revisions and experienced a
                    number of extensions, primarily hosted first at CERN, and then at the IETF.</p>

                <p>With the creation of the W3C, HTML's development changed venue again. A first abortive attempt at
                    extending HTML in 1995 known as HTML 3.0 then made way to a more pragmatic approach known as HTML
                    3.2, which was completed in 1997. HTML4 quickly followed later that same year.</p>

                <p>The following year, the W3C membership decided to stop evolving HTML and instead begin work on an
                    XML-based equivalent, called XHTML. This effort started with a reformulation of HTML4 in XML, known
                    as XHTML 1.0, which added no new features except the new serialization, and which was completed in
                    2000. After XHTML 1.0, the W3C's focus turned to making it easier for other working groups to extend
                    XHTML, under the banner of XHTML Modularization. In parallel with this, the W3C also worked on a new
                    language that was not compatible with the earlier HTML and XHTML languages, calling it XHTML2.</p>

                <p>Around the time that HTML's evolution was stopped in 1998, parts of the API for HTML developed by
                    browser vendors were specified and published under the name DOM Level 1 (in 1998) and DOM Level 2
                    Core and DOM Level 2 HTML (starting in 2000 and culminating in 2003). These efforts then petered
                    out, with some DOM Level 3 specifications published in 2004 but the working group being closed
                    before all the Level 3 drafts were completed.</p>

                <p>In 2003, the publication of XForms, a technology which was positioned as the next generation of web
                    forms, sparked a renewed interest in evolving HTML itself, rather than finding replacements for it.
                    This interest was borne from the realization that XML's deployment as a web technology was limited
                    to entirely new technologies (like RSS and later Atom), rather than as a replacement for existing
                    deployed technologies (like HTML).</p>

                <p>A proof of concept to show that it was possible to extend HTML4's forms to provide many of the
                    features that XForms 1.0 introduced, without requiring browsers to implement rendering engines that
                    were incompatible with existing HTML web pages, was the first result of this renewed interest. At
                    this early stage, while the draft was already publicly available, and input was already being
                    solicited from all sources, the specification was only under Opera Software's copyright.</p>

                <p>The idea that HTML's evolution should be reopened was tested at a W3C workshop in 2004, where some of
                    the principles that underlie the HTML5 work (described below), as well as the aforementioned early
                    draft proposal covering just forms-related features, were presented to the W3C jointly by Mozilla
                    and Opera. The proposal was rejected on the grounds that the proposal conflicted with the previously
                    chosen direction for the web's evolution; the W3C staff and membership voted to continue developing
                    XML-based replacements instead.</p>

                <p>Shortly thereafter, Apple, Mozilla, and Opera jointly announced their intent to continue working on
                    the effort under the umbrella of a new venue called the WHATWG. A public mailing list was created,
                    and the draft was moved to the WHATWG site. The copyright was subsequently amended to be jointly
                    owned by all three vendors, and to allow reuse of the specification.</p>

                <p>The WHATWG was based on several core principles, in particular that technologies need to be backwards
                    compatible, that specifications and implementations need to match even if this means changing the
                    specification rather than the implementations, and that specifications need to be detailed enough
                    that implementations can achieve complete interoperability without reverse-engineering each other.
                </p>

                <p>The latter requirement in particular required that the scope of the HTML5 specification include what
                    had previously been specified in three separate documents: HTML4, XHTML1, and DOM2 HTML. It also
                    meant including significantly more detail than had previously been considered the norm.</p>

                <p>In 2006, the W3C indicated an interest to participate in the development of HTML5 after all, and in
                    2007 formed a working group chartered to work with the WHATWG on the development of the HTML5
                    specification. Apple, Mozilla, and Opera allowed the W3C to publish the specification under the W3C
                    copyright, while keeping a version with the less restrictive license on the WHATWG site.</p>

                <p>For a number of years, both groups then worked together. In 2011, however, the groups came to the
                    conclusion that they had different goals: the W3C wanted to publish a &quot;finished&quot; version
                    of &quot;HTML5&quot;, while the WHATWG wanted to continue working on a Living Standard for HTML,
                    continuously maintaining the specification rather than freezing it in a state with known problems,
                    and adding new features as needed to evolve the platform.</p>

                <p>In 2019, the WHATWG and W3C signed an agreement to collaborate on a single version of HTML going
                    forward: this document.</p>

            <h1 id="1.7">1.7 Design Notes</h1>
            <article>
                <p>This section is non-normative.</p>

                <p>It must be admitted that many aspects of HTML appear at first glance to be nonsensical and
                    inconsistent.</p>

                <p>HTML, its supporting DOM APIs, as well as many of its supporting technologies, have been developed
                    over a period of several decades by a wide array of people with different priorities who, in many
                    cases, did not know of each other's existence.</p>

                <p>Features have thus arisen from many sources, and have not always been designed in especially
                    consistent ways. Furthermore, because of the unique characteristics of the web, implementation bugs
                    have often become de-facto, and now de-jure, standards, as content is often unintentionally written
                    in ways that rely on them before they can be fixed.</p>

                <p>Despite all this, efforts have been made to adhere to certain design goals. These are described in
                    the next few subsections.</p>

                        <h2 id="1.7.1">1.7.1 Serializability of script execution</h2>
                        <p>This section is non-normative.</p>
                        <p>To avoid exposing web authors to the complexities of multithreading, the HTML and DOM APIs
                            are
                            designed such that no script can ever detect the simultaneous execution of other scripts.
                            Even
                            with workers, the intent is that the behavior of implementations can be thought of as
                            completely
                            serializing the execution of all scripts in all browsing contexts.</p>
                        <p>The exception to this general design principle is the JavaScript SharedArrayBuffer class.
                            Using
                            SharedArrayBuffer objects, it can in fact be observed that scripts in other agents are
                            executing
                            simultaneously. Furthermore, due to the JavaScript memory model, there are situations which
                            not
                            only are un-representable via serialized script execution, but also un-representable via
                            serialized statement execution among those scripts.</p>

                        <p>This section is non-normative.</p>
                        <p>HTML has a wide array of extensibility mechanisms that can be used for adding semantics in a
                            safe manner:</p>
                        <ul class="bullet-list">
                            <li>
                                <p>Authors can use the <code>class</code> attribute to extend elements, effectively
                                    creating their own elements, while using the most applicable existing "real" HTML
                                    element, so that browsers and other tools that don't know of the extension can still
                                    support it somewhat well. This is the tack used by microformats, for example.</p>
                            </li></br>

                            <li>Authors can include data for inline client-side scripts or server-side site-wide scripts
                                to process using the <code>data-*=""</code> attributes. These are guaranteed to never be
                                touched by browsers, and allow scripts to include data on HTML elements that scripts can
                                then look for and process.</li></br>

                            <li>
                                <p>Authors can use the <code>meta name="" content=""</code> mechanism to include
                                    page-wide metadata.</p>
                            </li>

                            <li>Authors can use the <code>rel=""</code> mechanism to annotate links with specific
                                meanings by registering extensions to the predefined set of link types. This is also
                                used by microformats.</li>

                            <li>
                                <p>Authors can embed raw data using the <code>script type=" "</code> mechanism with a
                                    custom type, for further handling by inline or server-side scripts.</p>
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <p>Authors can create plugins and invoke them using the <code>embed</code> element. This
                                    is how Flash works.</p>
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <p>Authors can extend APIs using the JavaScript prototyping mechanism. This is widely
                                    used by script libraries, for instance.</p>
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <p>Authors can use the microdata feature (the <code>itemscope=""</code> and
                                    <code>itemprop=""</code> attributes) to embed nested name-value pairs of data to be
                                    shared with other applications and sites.</p>

            <header>Common Infrastructure</header>
            <h1 id="2.1">2.1 Terminology</h1>
            <article>
                <p>This specification refers to both HTML and XML attributes and IDL attributes, often in the same
                    context. When it is not clear which is being referred to, they are referred to as content attributes
                    for HTML and XML attributes, and IDL attributes for those defined on IDL interfaces. Similarly, the
                    term &quot;properties&quot; is used for both JavaScript object properties and CSS properties. When
                    these are ambiguous they are qualified as object properties and CSS properties respectively.</p>

                <p>Generally, when the specification states that a feature applies to the HTML syntax or the XML syntax,
                    it also includes the other. When a feature specifically only applies to one of the two languages, it
                    is called out by explicitly stating that it does not apply to the other format, as in &quot;for
                    HTML, ... (this does not apply to XML)&quot;.</p>

                <p>This specification uses the term document to refer to any use of HTML, ranging from short static
                    documents to long essays or reports with rich multimedia, as well as to fully-fledged interactive
                    applications. The term is used to refer both to Document objects and their descendant DOM trees, and
                    to serialized byte streams using the HTML syntax or the XML syntax, depending on context.</p>

                <p>In the context of the DOM structures, the terms HTML document and XML document are used as defined in
                    DOM, and refer specifically to two different modes that Document objects can find themselves in.
                    [DOM] (Such uses are always hyperlinked to their definition.)</p>

                <p>In the context of byte streams, the term HTML document refers to resources labeled as text/html, and
                    the term XML document refers to resources labeled with an XML MIME type.</p>

            <header>Semantics, Structure, and APIs of HTML documents</header>
            <h1 id="3.1">3.1 Documents</h1>
            <p>Every XML and HTML <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#document">Document</a> in an HTML UA is
                represented by a <code>Document</code> object. </p>
            <p>The <code>Document</code> object's <a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document-url>">URL</a>
                is defined in
                DOM. It is initially set when the <code>Document</code> object is created, but
                can change during the lifetime of the <code>Document</code> object; for example, it changes when the
                user <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#navigate">navigates</a>
                to a <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#scroll-to-fragid">fragment</a> on the page and when the <a
                    href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-history-pushstate"><code>pushState</code></a>() method is
                called with a
                new URL.</p>

            <div id="warning">
                <h2>Warning!</h2>
                <p>Interactive user agents typically expose the <a
                        href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#document">document</a> object's URL in their user interface.
                    This is the primary mechanism by which a user can tell if a site is attempting to impersonate
                    another.</p>
            </div>

            <p>When a <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#document"><code>Document</code></a> is created by a <a
                    href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-script">script</a> using the <a
                    href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-domimplementation-createdocument"><code>createDocument()</code></a>
                or <a
                    href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-domimplementation-createhtmldocument"><code>createHTMLDocument()</code></a>
                the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#document"><code>Document</code></a> is both <a
                    href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#ready-for-post-load-tasks">ready for post-load tasks</a> and <a
                    href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#completely-loaded">completely loaded</a> immediately.</p>
            <p><strong>The document's referrer</strong> is a string (representing a URL) that can be set when the <a
                    href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#document"><code>Document</code></a> is created. If it is not
                explicitly set,
                then its value is the empty string.</p>

            <h2 id="3.1.1">3.1.1 The Document object</h2>
            <p>DOM defines a Document interface, which this specification extends significantly.</p></br>

            <h1 id="4.1">4.1 The document element</h1>
            <h2 id="4.1.1">4.1.1 The html element</h2>
            <p>The html element represents the root of an HTML document.</p>

            <p>Authors are encouraged to specify a lang attribute on the root html element, giving the document's
                language. This aids speech synthesis tools to determine what pronunciations to use, translation tools to
                determine what rules to use, and so forth.</p>

            <p>The manifest attribute gives the address of the document's application cache manifest, if there is one.
                If the attribute is present, the attribute's value must be a valid non-empty URL potentially surrounded
                by spaces.</p>

            <p>The manifest attribute is part of the legacy "offline web applications" feature, which is in the process
                of being removed from the web platform. (This is a long process that takes many years.) Using the
                manifest attribute at this time is highly discouraged. Use service workers instead.</p>

            <p>The manifest attribute only has an effect during the early stages of document load. Changing the
                attribute dynamically thus has no effect (and thus, no DOM API is provided for this attribute).</p>

            <p>For the purposes of application cache selection, later base elements cannot affect the parsing of URLs in
                manifest attributes, as the attributes are processed before those elements are seen.</p>

            <p>The window.applicationCache IDL attribute provides scripted access to the offline application cache mechanism.</p></br>

            <p>This section is non-normative.</p>

            <p>Sometimes, it is desirable to annotate content with specific machine-readable labels, e.g. to allow
                generic scripts to provide services that are customized to the page, or to enable content from a variety
                of cooperating authors to be processed by a single script in a consistent manner.</p>

            <p>For this purpose, authors can use the microdata features described in this section. Microdata allows
                nested groups of name-value pairs to be added to documents, in parallel with the existing content.</p>
